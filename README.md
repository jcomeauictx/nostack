This is a very simple Chrome or Chromium extension to replace any links to any
substack publishers with the official page of the CDC. This will prevent you
from being exposed to any subversive content that may conflict with the official
government narratives on Covid-19 and any other health concerns.

To install the extension:
   1. `git clone` this repository
   2. `cd nostack` and `make icon.png`
   3. Open a new tab and visit <chrome://extensions>
   4. At the top right, slide the Developer Mode button to the right if it isn't already there.
   5. At the left, click [Load unpacked] and navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.
   6. Click [Open] at the bottom right of the pop-up window. You may need to maximize the window if it's not visible.
